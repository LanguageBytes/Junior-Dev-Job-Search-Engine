# <p align = "center" > Junior Developer Job Search Engine </p>

For this project we designed an application to search for junior developer jobs. The user story is as follows:

```
AS A junior developer
I WANT to be able to search for job opportunities
SO THAT I can find jobs that are relevant to me

GIVEN I am searching for a job
WHEN I am presented with the search field
THEN I can refine my search by location

WHEN I click the submit button
THEN I am presented with a list of search results that matches my search criteria

WHEN I have made a search
THEN it will be saved for me to refer back to in the future

WHEN I click on a job in the list
THEN I am presented with a description of the job with a link to apply
```

Technologies used included:

- html
- css
- javascript
- Tailwind
- Fontawesome
- Google Maps APIs (location map, search map)
- Reed APIs (job search and job details)

Locations of top tech hirers are displayed on a map on the home page, and a map is present on the job description page for the user to manually search for locations if required.

The link for the deployed application is as follows: https://languagebytes.github.io/Junior-Dev-Job-Search-Engine/
