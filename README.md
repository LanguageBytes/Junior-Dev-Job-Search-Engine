AS A junior developer
I WANT to be able to search for job opportunities 
SO THAT I can find jobs that are relevant to me

GIVEN I am searching for a job
WHEN I am presented with the search field
THEN I can refine my search by location

WHEN I click the submit button
THEN I am presented with a list of search results that matches my search criteria

WHEN I have made a search 
THEN it will be saved for me to refer back to in the future

WHEN I click on a job in the list
THEN I am presented with a description of the job with a link to apply
